Compute the Body Mass Index (BMI)
1. Ask the user to input his/her full name
2. Ask the user to input his/her weight in pounds,
3. the height in feet,
4. and the height in inches,
5. Calculate the BMI
6. Display the userâ€™s name along with the value of BMI using the format shown in the sample run, below.
The simple formula to calculate the BMI is:
BMI = weight in pounds * 703 / (height in inches2 )
If you pick descriptive variable names (a requirement for this course), your programming life would be much easier.
Format all output with 3 digits after the decimal point.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
weight_lbs = float(input("Enter your weight in pounds = "))
height_ft = float(input("Enter your height in feet = "))
height_in = float(input("Enter your height in inches = "))

#calculate height
height = (height_ft*12) + height_in

#calculate BMI
BMI = (weight_lbs/height**2)*703

#6 display the user's name along w/the value of BMI
print("{}, Your Body Mass Index is: {}".format(name,round(BMI,3)))
